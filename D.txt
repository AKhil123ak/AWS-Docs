what is API

IAM
+++
who has admin access in real time
what kind of permissions do we give to developers or testers etc..
whom do we give programming login access in real time

need to learn encryption keys if needed

VPC

pageant
use of VPC peering
endpoint policies
what is the use of assigning multiple ips to an instance

EC2

need to know more about snapshots and when do we used to take it
how to make the EBS volume encrypted and use it. as by default, it is not encrypted
need to practice decreasing the volume size along with the cofigurations on server
can't we start the instance without root volume?

ELB
++++
how can we know the unhealthy servers detected by load balancer? will it trigger any alert or something
is there any way we can know which server the traffic is going currentlly
how do we use load balancer in real time
if traffic is going to different servers then where the logs be stored
do we need to configure the same application on both the servers. if not then how the replication done between both the servers

Auto scaling:
+++++++++++++
how autiscaling works, will it automatically adds the maximum no of instances one after one once the threshold is reached. or it just adds 1 and checks again for the threshold to add another one
for which servers can we use auto scaling? only for web servers?

S3
+++
need to learn s3 integrated with maven within pom.xml
what purpose we create IAM role in s3 while doing cross zone replication
