how are we able to access POD IP from rdg. how the access enabled
does the pod and service IPs gets create in the same range of IPs which we give while creating the cluster.
why can't we access service IP from rdg, is it because of cluster IP? need to try with nodeport of one server.
does nodeport generated public IP rather than picking it from the IP range we give or it just enabled the internet access to the ip which gets created from the range.
need to know how the connection enables between rdg and kubernetes pods.
need to check does really service deletion removes pod.

do we need cluster to be exposed to the internet for the load balancer to create public iP? or atlease the master or the node where service is running.

does the pods automatically gets the connection to the service created with cluster IP? if not,how the connection happenning from frontend to backend redis.
need to understand more on cluster IP configuration.

does k8s automatically creates storage volumes on cloud with dynamic storage class?
what if we run kubectl delete command with the yaml file of PV?

what will happen if we run kubectl delete command on storage class yaml file? will it delete the same colume which got created?
or will it deletes the volume on cloud when we delete storage class in k8s cluster?
if it doesn't delete volume in cloud with storage class deletion, how can we restore it again?should we use PV again or any other option?
what will happen when we delete the volume in cloud while it still being used by PV or storage class?

basically, what is the name the dynamic PV creates the volume in cloud? what if we change it?
